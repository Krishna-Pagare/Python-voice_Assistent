# Python-voice_Assistent
This is a Python voice Assistent and it can do many more things with apis add your code accordingly


I have used Vs_code for the project you can use your favourite editor

The modules I used were:

import speech_recognition as sr

from gtts import gTTS

import os

import time

import playsound

import pyttsx3

import datetime

import subprocess

import webbrowser

The os module the time module the datetime module and the subprocess module are preinstalled in the python code and others can be installed with pip. 
You can add your api code in the same format
